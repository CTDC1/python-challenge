#For Module 3 Python-Challenge I worked with a learning tutor for both bank and poll

#the learning tutor taught me an easier way to write print statements, so I did not have to write all my print statement for each line of the final report

#the learning tutor also showed me how to using a formatting string at the end of a variable in an fstring so I can round up, add commas after three digits, and add a $ sign
